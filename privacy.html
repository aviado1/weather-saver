      <p>Last updated: 22 August 2025</p>
      <p>This policy explains how Weather Saver by EverGreenNY handles personal data.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No accounts and no sign in.</li>
      <li>No analytics and no advertising trackers.</li>
      <li>Optional geolocation is requested by your browser only when you click Use my location. We do not store it on our server.</li>
      <li>Weather and photos come from third party providers. Only the minimum data required for those requests is sent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What we collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Server logs</strong> standard web logs such as IP address, request URL, user agent and timestamp. We use them for security and to operate the service. Logs are kept for a short period, typically up to 30 days, then removed or aggregated.</li>
      <li><strong>Geolocation</strong> if you grant permission in your browser, we read your approximate latitude and longitude to fetch weather. We do not persist location on our server.</li>
      <li><strong>Local preferences</strong> we may store the last city name and simple settings in your browser localStorage so the site can remember your choices. This data stays on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third party providers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>OpenWeather</strong> to retrieve weather data for a city or coordinates.</li>
      <li><strong>Pexels</strong> to retrieve background photos that match the chosen city. Photographer attribution is shown.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Requests to these providers are sent through our server so the API keys remain hidden. The providers may receive your IP address and query parameters required to serve the request. Their use of data is governed by their own policies.</p>

    <h2>Cookies and local storage</h2>
    <p>We do not set analytics or advertising cookies. We may use a minimal first party cookie or localStorage for essential preferences. You can clear it at any time from your browser settings.</p>

    <h2>Data sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell personal data. We share data only with service providers that help us operate the site, as described above, and only to the extent necessary.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the site. No method of transmission or storage is completely secure.</p>

    <h2>International users</h2>
    <p>Your data may be processed in countries where our servers or providers operate. By using the site you consent to this processing.</p>

    <h2>Your rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct or delete personal data we hold about you. Since we keep very little, requests are usually simple. Contact us to exercise your rights.</p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>The site is intended for a general audience and does not target children. If you believe we collected personal data from a child, contact us and we will address it.</p>

    <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. The latest version will always be posted on this page.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
